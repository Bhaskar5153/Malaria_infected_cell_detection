# Malaria_infected_cell_detection

This project is about creating a deep-learning model to detect the malaria-infected cell.
The data set has been collected from https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-downloads/dataset.html
We have ~ 12500 images for training and testing the data set.
CNN deep learning model has been used to train the data set.
The model is currently running at 94%.
